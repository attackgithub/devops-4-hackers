# devops-4-hackers

## Overview

Devops 4 Hackers provides prebuilt virtual machines that can be customized to fit your needs with the power of Vagrant. The point of this project is to make it easier to build virtual machines for security testing of vulnerable software and operating systems. These builds can be used to conduct both sides of a pentest.

This project should help save time and create environments that can be destroyed easily without having to worry about taking the time to rebuild a virtual machine.
